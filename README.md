#  Hi! My name is Simone Girardi

I'm a Physics student @ the university of Trento.
Currently I'm studying Experimental Physics and advanced Electronics.
I've got my bachelor degree in september 2022, for which I did a thesis regarding the [Chua's Chaotic Circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc) (feel free to check it out!).


Some of my other interests, other than physics, are:
  - **Computers:** My main system is on a linux machine. I love to make automation scripts, for example to backup data on a remote server or changing the charging    threshold of the computer battery since in linux obviuslly does not exists.

  - **Cars:** I'm working with [E-Agle TRT](https://www.eagletrt.it/) to build a formula style racecar to hopefully race in the Formula Student!
