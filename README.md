#  Hi! My name is Simone Girardi

I'm a **Physicist** and currently I'm working as electronic engineer.
I've got my bachelor degree in september 2022, for which I did a thesis regarding the [Chua's Chaotic Circuit](https://github.com/SimoneGirardi/ChuaCircuit_Thesis) (feel free to check it out!).


Some of my other interests, other than physics and electronics, are:
  - **Computers:** My main system is on a linux machine. I love to make automation scripts, for example to backup data on a remote server or changing the charging threshold of the computer battery since in linux does not exists.

  - **Cars:** I've worked with [E-Agle TRT](https://www.eagletrt.it/) to build an electric formula style racecar and raced it in Varano de Melegari and at the Hockenheimring
